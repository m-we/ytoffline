Add subs to subs.txt with the format channel_name|channel_id. Limit of 15 videos per channel b/c this is how YouTube does their RSS feeds. Not as pretty as a subscription page, but you don't need a Google account to use it. Lists videos from the past week by default, if you want a longer time period you can edit that in the script.
